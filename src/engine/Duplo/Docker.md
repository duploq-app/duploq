# Duplo (C/C++/Java Duplicate Source Code Block Finder)

This project is found in GitHub: [https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo](https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo).

## General Information

Duplicated source code blocks can harm maintainability of software systems.
Duplo is a tool to find duplicated code blocks in large C, C++, Java, C# and
VB.Net systems.

## Maintainer

Duplo was originally developed by Christian
M. Ammann and is now maintained and developed by Daniel
LidstrÃ¶m.

## Usage

Duplo works with a list of files. You can either specify a file that contains the list of files, or you can pass them using `stdin`.

Run `duplo --help` on the command line to see the detailed options.

### Passing files using `stdin`

```bash
# Docker on unix
> find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -or -iname "*.h" \) | docker run --rm -i -w /src -v $(pwd):/src dlidstrom/duplo - out.txt
```

`duplo` will write the duplicated blocks into `out.txt`.

### Passing files using file

`duplo` can analyze files specified in a separate file:

```bash
# Docker on unix
> find . -type f \( -iname "*.cpp" -o -iname "*.h" \) > files.lst
> docker run --rm -i -w /src -v $(pwd):/src dlidstrom/duplo files.lst out.txt
```

Again, `duplo` will write the duplicated blocks into `out.txt`.
